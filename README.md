#### Predict NBA outcomes using machine learning models

This project is part of the experiments I did to get my master degree in Artificial Intelligence.
 
So far, this project propose two models capable of:

- Game Winner Model: As its name implies this model try to predict which team 
is going to win a game, 
specifically a regular season NBA game(for now).
- Point Spread Model: This model try to predict an estimation of  
margin of victory of a winner team on a regular season NBA Game. 
This means by how many points a team may win that game.
